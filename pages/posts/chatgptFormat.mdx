Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. It makes it easy to create performant and scalable web apps, with automatic code splitting and optimized performance out of the box.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps of setting up a basic Next.js app and adding some simple components to it.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 10 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Setting Up the Project

To create a new Next.js app, we'll use the `create-next-app` command. Open up a terminal and run the following:


This will create a new directory called `my-app` and set up a basic Next.js project inside it.

## Adding Components

Next.js uses the concept of "pages" to define the different routes in your app. Each page is a React component that gets rendered on the server and sent to the client.

To create a new page, create a new file in the `pages` directory with a `.js` extension. For example, to create a page for the home route, create a file at `pages/index.js`.

Inside the page component, you can add any React components or JSX that you want to render on the page. Here's an example of a simple home page component:


```jsx 
import React from 'react'

export default function Blog({}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app!</h1>
      <p>This is the home page.</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

</div>
